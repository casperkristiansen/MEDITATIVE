### APP DESCRIPTION & MOTIVATION ###
MEDITATIVE is an APP for meditation purposes. In MEDITATIVE the user can relax and get meditative by listening to relaxing music and sounds.
By choosing your mood, the app will play music/sounds to accompany your mood. It is also possible to browse all available tracks to play the track that you find encouraging.
The app will feature a Diary function, that allows the user to choose their current mood and describe their feelings and thoughts for the purpose of being able to look back at your thoughts at a later time.

The motivation for creating this app is based on the fact that the world nowadays can be stressful and challenging. MEDITATIVE will help the user to focus on their thoughts and feelings.
This will enable them to understand themselves and thereby live a richer and happier life on a day to day basis. 
MEDITATIVE will be a tool to escape from the stress of today, by allowing yourself to calm down for a moment and relax. This will help by being able to cope with everyday challenges.
